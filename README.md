## Welcome to the Wetfeet Tutorials for Scala!

Maybe it's just me, but when I wanna try out a new technology I want to see it in action as quickly as possible. I want to get my hands dirty (and feet wet ;-) and play with the stuff rather than wade through lengthy introductions or verbose documentation (you know: 'running software over extensive documentation'!).

So here's what's in there for you:
* minimal setup
* minimal dependencies
* a readme that fits on (not much more than) a page
* very simple (or even simplistic) to-the-point sample code for minimal distraction
* proposals on what to do next once you're up and running
* a handful of resources
* I want you to have a sample running within 5 minutes!

**Have Fun!**
